TODO for FKmod
##############

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units, especially cyborgs
* Shorter research time for some research topics
* Cyborg Cannon replacement/new template not working
* Indicate special version of weapons in Cyborg name
* Designable cyborgs for debug purposes
* Combine structure and defensive structure researches 
* Fix ROF research effects: implemented effect = reduction of reload time; wanted effect = increase in shots per time
* Cluster Bombs: damage too low
* Grenade Launcher: increase Mk 1 splash radius from 192 to 256, Mk 2 splash radius from 256 to 288, leave Mk 3 splash radius at 320

Code
----
* (Re)implement weapon angle check
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Re-implement incendiary effect
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!
* HP bug with HP > HP_max?
* Disable bungee effect when changing viewport via mini-map
* Update physics such that hover tanks with high speeds use brakes before curves
* VTOL Strike Tower Micro AI is stupid
	* sends VTOLs back, when the target is down, although other targets still exist
	* does not pick target with highest possible damage, e. g. not center points in groups, if splash damage is available
* Unit micro AI is stupid
	* Walls are not attacked at will

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Transport does not work
* Add CITATION file (http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-09-02-encouraging-citation-software-introducing-citation-files)
* Surveillance Tower: Sensor is floating on top of tower
* Propulsion changing: Changing the propulsion of an existing design does not change until weapon is changed afterwards

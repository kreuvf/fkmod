TODO for FKmod
##############

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units
* Shorter research time for some research topics
* weaken defensive structures
* Bombs throw infos when shown on design screen:
	info    |07:58:11: [displayComponentButton:419] Assert in Warzone: component.cpp:419 (ComponentIMD), last script event: '<none>'
	info    |07:58:11: [getComponentRadius:128] No ComponentIMD!
	info    |07:58:11: [getComponentRadius:128] Assert in Warzone: component.cpp:128 (ComponentIMD), last script event: '<none>'
	info    |07:58:11: [displayComponentButton:419] No ComponentIMD
	* Fix needs to include changes to more weapon subclasses patch since in component.cpp an exception is made for WSC_BOMB (we use WSC_HOTBOMB, WSC_HEAVYBOMB, WSC_CLUSTERBOMB only!) --> exception not applied --> warning message

Code
----
* (Re)implement weapon angle check
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Re-implement incendiary effect
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Transport does not work

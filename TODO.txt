TODO for FKmod

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units
* Shorter research time for some research topics
* weaken defensive structures
* Bombs throw infos when research is displayed:
	info    |07:58:11: [displayComponentButton:419] Assert in Warzone: component.cpp:419 (ComponentIMD), last script event: '<none>'
	info    |07:58:11: [getComponentRadius:128] No ComponentIMD!

	info    |07:58:11: [displayComponentButton:419] No ComponentIMD

Code
----
* (Re)implement weapon angle check
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Re-implement incendiary effect
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Transport does not work

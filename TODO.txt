TODO for FKmod
==============

Requirements for Final Version
------------------------------
* Code: EMP weapons should do some damage
* Balancing
	* MG damage vs. ground units too high
	* VTOL MG too strong
	* FLAMER structure modifier bit too low
* Convert data files to new format
    * weapons require %min. damage value
    * propulsion require deceleration or skidDeceleration
* Cyborgs do not get Autorepair
* Grenade Launcher triggers CB fire when ground unit in CB range gets attacked (does not trigger when firing at structures)

Nice to Have for Final Version
------------------------------
Code
----
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* Flamer incendiary damage can burn the same target multiple times, when penetrate is on
	* Penetrate = on impact, spawn new projectile
	* new projectile lands somewhere, sets fire to the area -> burn effect from new projectile
	* Solution: Add information on parent and child projectiles to every projectile; when adding new projectile's effect, add current projectile if and only if the parent projectile and no child projectile already affects the target
* VTOL Strike Tower Micro AI is stupid
	* sends VTOLs back, when the target is down, although other targets still exist
	* does not pick target with highest possible damage, e. g. not center points in groups, if splash damage is available
* Unit micro AI is stupid
	* Walls are not attacked at will
* VTOL Strike Tower menu to select target classes (aerial, ground, mobile)

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Surveillance Tower: Sensor is floating on top of tower
* Propulsion changing: Changing the propulsion of an existing design does not change until weapon is changed afterwards
* Maybe use Super cyborg models for easier selection

TODO for FKmod
==============

Requirements for Final Version
------------------------------
* Stormbringer AA damage too low (incl. incendiary damage which is non-existent)
* Flamer
	* Change special upgrades away from range
	* Add penetrate
	* Set range to 768
	* Micro salvoes? Continuous fire?	
* VTOL bomb research
	* Make available all bomb researches after VTOL research

Nice to Have for Final Version
------------------------------
Code
----
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* VTOL Strike Tower Micro AI is stupid
	* sends VTOLs back, when the target is down, although other targets still exist
	* does not pick target with highest possible damage, e. g. not center points in groups, if splash damage is available
* Unit micro AI is stupid
	* Walls are not attacked at will
* VTOL Strike Tower menu to select target classes (aerial, ground, mobile)

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Surveillance Tower: Sensor is floating on top of tower
* Propulsion changing: Changing the propulsion of an existing design does not change until weapon is changed afterwards
* Maybe use Super cyborg models for easier selection

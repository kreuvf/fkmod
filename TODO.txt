TODO for FKmod
##############

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units
* Shorter research time for some research topics
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!
* weaken defensive structures
* Construction cyborg neither available at start nor researchable
* Repair cyborg not available through research
* Bombs throw infos when research is displayed:
	info    |07:58:11: [displayComponentButton:419] Assert in Warzone: component.cpp:419 (ComponentIMD), last script event: '<none>'
	info    |07:58:11: [getComponentRadius:128] No ComponentIMD!
	info    |07:58:11: [getComponentRadius:128] Assert in Warzone: component.cpp:128 (ComponentIMD), last script event: '<none>'
	info    |07:58:11: [displayComponentButton:419] No ComponentIMD
* Remove one of two truck templates available from start

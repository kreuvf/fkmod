TODO for FKmod
##############

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units, especially cyborgs
* Shorter research time for some research topics
* no corner walls
* Add function checkEndConditions to rules.js
* Message when VTOL MG is firing:
info    |04:29:06: [proj_InFlightFunc:739] Bad WSC_NUM_WEAPON_SUBCLASS.
info    |04:29:06: [proj_InFlightFunc:739] Assert in Warzone: projectile.cpp:739 (false), last script event: '<none>'
* Anti-Air weapons need to be stronger (at least Cyclone)
* Heavy Bombs need to be a bit stronger
* Armour of defensive structures still a little bit too high
* js_enableTemplate: Template ConstructorDroid not found; maybe due to rules.js line
* VTOL MG needs to be ANTI PERSONNEL
* AA weapon warhead types need to be checked
* Anti Tank modifier vs. Lift too low

Code
----
* (Re)implement weapon angle check
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Re-implement incendiary effect
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!
* HP bug with HP > HP_max?

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Transport does not work

TODO for FKmod
##############

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units, especially cyborgs
* Shorter research time for some research topics
* weaken defensive structures
* HP bug with HP > HP_max?
* Scourge Missile upgrade names swapped?
* Rocket Battery upgrade names swapped?
* Cannon cyborg WAY too slow
* Artilery: more damage vs. walls, less damage vs. cyborgs
* Ripple Rockets Pit is called Ripple Rockets Site

Code
----
* (Re)implement weapon angle check
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Re-implement incendiary effect
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Transport does not work

TODO for FKmod
##############

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units, especially cyborgs
* Shorter research time for some research topics
* HQ = new command building (kick out ugly command building)
* Mini-map and design always active

Code
----
* (Re)implement weapon angle check
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Re-implement incendiary effect
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!
* HP bug with HP > HP_max?
* Disable bungee effect when changing viewport via mini-map

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Transport does not work
* Add CITATION file (http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-09-02-encouraging-citation-software-introducing-citation-files)

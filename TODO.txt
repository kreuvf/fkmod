TODO for FKmod
==============

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units, especially cyborgs

Code
----
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!
* Disable bungee effect when changing viewport via mini-map
* Update physics such that hover tanks with high speeds use brakes before curves
* VTOL Strike Tower Micro AI is stupid
	* sends VTOLs back, when the target is down, although other targets still exist
	* does not pick target with highest possible damage, e. g. not center points in groups, if splash damage is available
* Unit micro AI is stupid
	* Walls are not attacked at will
* Make incendiary effects apply to units

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Surveillance Tower: Sensor is floating on top of tower
* Propulsion changing: Changing the propulsion of an existing design does not change until weapon is changed afterwards

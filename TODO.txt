TODO for FKmod
==============

Stats
-----
* Higher production speed for certain units, especially cyborgs
* Shorter research time for some research topics
* Obsolete cyborg templates are not removed
* Combine structure and defensive structure researches 
* Fix ROF research effects: implemented effect = reduction of reload time; wanted effect = increase in shots per time
* Make incendiary effect work (like in 3.1.x)

Code
----
* (Re)implement weapon angle check
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* faster repair at rearming stations: needs fix in structure.cpp:aiUpdateStructure (lines 2629 to 3518) and probably lots of other places; rearming speed is not taken into consideration (lines 3489 to 3492)!
* HP bug with HP > HP_max?
* Disable bungee effect when changing viewport via mini-map
* Update physics such that hover tanks with high speeds use brakes before curves
* VTOL Strike Tower Micro AI is stupid
	* sends VTOLs back, when the target is down, although other targets still exist
	* does not pick target with highest possible damage, e. g. not center points in groups, if splash damage is available
* Unit micro AI is stupid
	* Walls are not attacked at will

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Transport does not work
* Add CITATION file (http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2013-09-02-encouraging-citation-software-introducing-citation-files)
* Surveillance Tower: Sensor is floating on top of tower
* Propulsion changing: Changing the propulsion of an existing design does not change until weapon is changed afterwards

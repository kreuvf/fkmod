TODO for FKmod
==============

Requirements for Final Version
------------------------------
Stats
-----
* Add scout sensor
* Increase surveillance sensor range

Code
----
* Artillery uses non-artillery sensors --> add different sensor types
* Scout sensor needs implementation?
* action.cpp: look at VTOL_ATTACK_LENGTH & co. defines


Nice to Have for Final Version
------------------------------
Code
----
* Debug switch to turn off data checking
* Update physics such that hover tanks with high speeds use brakes before curves
* VTOL Strike Tower Micro AI is stupid
	* sends VTOLs back, when the target is down, although other targets still exist
	* does not pick target with highest possible damage, e. g. not center points in groups, if splash damage is available
* Unit micro AI is stupid
	* Walls are not attacked at will
* Enable auto-repair for VTOLs

Miscellaneous
-------------
* Surveillance Tower: Sensor is floating on top of tower
* Propulsion changing: Changing the propulsion of an existing design does not change until weapon is changed afterwards

Upstream bug: When playing with Windows 10 and Ubuntu 16.04, the game desyncs when firing certain weapons (rockets, missiles).
Burn effect stacks: Multiple burn effects stack causing enormous damage per second and almost instantly killing cyborgs
Upstream bug: Autorepair does not apply to units produced via the debug menu.
Accuracy research: Due to different base accuracies for Machine Guns, Autocannons and Grenade Launcher the 10% decrease of the current probability to miss the target was calculated for the better of the variants only; this makes the upgrades for the less accurate weapon less effective

Not reproducable:
ab79eb07fa462f066d180ba638476c12d5b29e7d
* Conditions for checking victory do not work sometimes
* Grenade Launcher triggers CB fire when ground unit in CB range gets attacked (does not trigger when firing at structures)

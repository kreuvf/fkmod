The scripts in this directory serve the purpose to convert the default Warzone 2100 Project maps to FKmod. Basically, structures and units get renamed and removed.

The Bash script takes care of converting names, while the Python script is used for properly reading and manipulating the JSON files to remove entries. Both are called by maps2fkmaps.sh.

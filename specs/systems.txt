Systems

Sensors
- special sensor for surveillance without any normal (i. e. targetting for artillery) ability
- special sensor for scouting without any normal (i. e. targetting for artillery, assigned units etc. pp.) sensor ability; for tanks, VTOLs and as a Cyborg
- normal sensor, CB, VTOL Strike for normal buildings
- no other sensors
- Note (to be deleted when research is specified): scout sensor --> normal sensor --> all other sensors

Commander
- one commander turret for tanks
- Commander Cyborg (probably use unused Super Cyborg body)

Repair
- Autorepair enabled by default (it's 2100!!111), but very slow
- Repair facility repair speed ~= 3-4 * Tank repair speed
- Tank repair speed ~= 2 * Cyborg repair speed
- Cyborg repair speed >> Autorepair repair speed
- upgradable through research

Constructors
- Tank Constructor construction speed ~= 2 * Cyborg Constructor construction speed
- Cyborg Constructor

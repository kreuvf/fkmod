- Commander Cyborg (probably use unused Super Cyborg body)

Repair
- Autorepair enabled by default (it's 2100!!111), but very slow
- Repair facility repair speed ~= 3-4 * Tank repair speed
- Tank repair speed ~= 2 * Cyborg repair speed
- Cyborg repair speed >> Autorepair repair speed
- upgradable through research

Constructors
- Tank Constructor construction speed ~= 2 * Cyborg Constructor construction speed
- Cyborg Constructor

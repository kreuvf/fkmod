Starting Technologies (= first technologies you can research)
- R-W-FF-Machinegun
- R-W-SF-Railgun
- R-W-MIS-ScourgeMissile
- R-Res1
- R-NRG1
- R-SensorSurveillance

Basic Technologies (= technologies you start with = you researched before game start)
- basic technologies are NOT listed in the above listing since you never really research them and having them as a research prerequisite is pointless as well; thus, the names given here are the names these technologies _would_ have, if they were researchable
- R-B-Start (Start Body)
- R-B-Cyborg (Cyborg Body)
- R-C-Tank (Tank Constructor)
- R-C-Cyborg (Cyborg Constructor)
- R-P-Tracks
- R-P-Cyborg (Cyborg legs...)
- R-St-Headquarter
- R-St-PowerGenerator
- R-St-ResearchFacility
- R-St-TankFactory
- R-St-CyborgFactory
- R-Rep-Autorepair

Technology Tree Branches
- Weapon upgrades Mk1 require the weapon, further upgrades require the previous upgrade; special upgrades appear at the end (with exactly one upgrade) or at 5/3/3 and at the end (with exactly two upgrades)
- Weapon + Defense structure type --> Dummy Research
- Research upgrades require only the previous research upgrade
- Scout Sensor --> Artillery Sensor --> other sensors

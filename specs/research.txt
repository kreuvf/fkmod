Research
- generally: fewer research topics, longer research times --> more time, more energy, more attention for building base/units
- general guidelines:
	- approx. 15 min to get to any one weapon
	- weapon upgrades generally aim to strengthen the weapon characteristics (more ROF upgrades for MG, more damage upgrades for cannons etc. pp.)
	- research time calculations are based on the arithmetic mean of the min. and max. research speed

Weapon research
- Weapon upgrades do not magically transform a weapon into an uberweapon
- Three weapon upgrade categories: damage, ROF, accuracy
- for every upgrade values should become 10% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +10% of base value, second upgrade: +21% of base value, third upgrade: +33,1% of base value etc. pp.)
- each weapon has one major and two minor weapon upgrade categories
- the major weapon upgrade category has 7 upgrades
	- cumulated research time: approx. 45 min
	- research time for upgrades depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,1 * x + 1,1^2 * x + 1,1^3 * x + 1,1^4 * x + 1,1^5 * x + 1,1^6 * x = 45 ==> x approx. 4 min 45 s
- the minor weapon upgrade categories have 5 upgrades each
	- cumulated research time per category: approx. 45 min
	- also 45 min because it's harder to research something that's not part of the weapon's core characteristics (or in other words: the researches responsible are 
	- research time for upgrades depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,1 * x + 1,1^2 * x + 1,1^3 * x + 1,1^4 * x = 45 ==> x approx. 7 min 20 s
- calculations for accuracy: 10% of (1 - hit%) = increase in hit% with last upgrade
- upgrades are for each weapon individually, so that every research affects only one weapon
- Weapon groups and main weapon upgrade category:
Weapon group	Main Weapon Upgrade Category
Fast-Fire Weapons	ROF
Slow-Fire Weapons	Damage
Rockets	Accuracy
Howitzers	Damage
Rocket Battery	Accuracy
Thermal Weapons	Damage
Splash Weapons	Damage
- Chance to get splash damage is always 100 %
- additional special upgrades for certain weapons such as increases in shots per salvo, enabling penetration etc. pp.
- Weapons and special upgrades
Weapon	Special Upgrade(s)
MG for Cyborgs/Structures	Higher projectile speed and improved turret pitches (min. and max.)
MG for VTOLs/Tanks	2 x increase of load per salvo
Hurricane AA		2 x lowering min. pitch
Heavy Cannon for Cyborgs		enable partial fire while moving, enable full fire while moving
Heavy Cannon for Structures	Addition of small/low splash damage, extension of long range
Heavy Bombs	2 x mass reduction
Rail Gun	Enable penetration
Cyclone AA	2 x lowering min. pitch
Scourge	homing
Lancer	Usable vs. aerial targets (for Cyborgs only)
Avenger SAM	homing

Flamer	2 x range
Incendiary Bomb	Burn effect radius, mass
Laser	penetration
Stormbringer AA	penetration
Grenade Launcher	2 x splash radius
Cluster Bombs	Splash radius, mass

Body research
- 4 upgrade categories
	- Engine output
	- Body points
	- Kinetic armour
	- Thermal armour
- Upgrades for armours and body points apply to all units
- Upgrades for engine output apply to vehicles only (means: no cyborgs)
- for engine output upgrade values should become 5% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +5% of base value, second upgrade: +10% of base value, third upgrade: +15,8% of base value etc. pp.)
- for every other upgrade values should become 10% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +10% of base value, second upgrade: +21% of base value, third upgrade: +33,1% of base value etc. pp.)
- 5 upgrades for each upgrade category
	- cumulated research time: approx. 60 min
	- research time for engine output upgrades depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,05 * x + 1,05^2 * x + 1,05^3 * x + 1,05^4 * x = 60 ==> x approx. 10 min 50 s
	- research time for every other upgrade depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,1 * x + 1,1^2 * x + 1,1^3 * x + 1,1^4 * x = 60 ==> x approx. 9 min 50 s

Research research
- 5 upgrades
- for every upgrade values should become 10% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +10% of base value, second upgrade: +21% of base value, third upgrade: +33,1% of base value etc. pp.)
	- cumulated research time: approx. 60 min
	- research time depends on the time of the first upgrade x; since with every upgrade research speed is increased by 10% and thereby research time is multiplied with 0,909 this factor needs to be cancelled out by another +10%: x + 1,1 * 0,909 * 1,1 * x + (1,1 * 0,909)^2 * 1,1^2 * x + (1,1 * 0,909)^3 * 1,1^3 * x + (1,1 * 0,909)^4 * 1,1^4 * x  = 60 ==> x approx. 9 min 50 s; this has an impact on upgrade prices! price of first upgrade x: x + 1,1^2 * x + 1,1^4 * x + 1,1^6 * x + 1,1^8 * x = PRICE

Energy research
- 10 upgrades
- for every upgrade values should become 5% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +5% of base value, second upgrade: +10% of base value, third upgrade: +15,8% of base value etc. pp.)
	- cumulated research time: approx. 90 min
	- research time depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,05 * x + 1,05^2 * x + 1,05^3 * x + 1,05^4 * x + 1,05^5 * x + 1,05^6 * x + 1,05^7 * x + 1,05^8 * x + 1,05^9 * x = 90 ==> x approx. 7 min 10 s

Production research
- no research

Construction research
- no research

Structure research
- 2 upgrade categories
	- Body points
	- Kinetic/Thermal armour
- for every other upgrade values should become 10% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +10% of base value, second upgrade: +21% of base value, third upgrade: +33,1% of base value etc. pp.)
- 5 upgrades for each upgrade category
	- cumulated research time: approx. 60 min
	- research time for every other upgrade depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,1 * x + 1,1^2 * x + 1,1^3 * x + 1,1^4 * x = 60 ==> x approx. 9 min 50 s

Defense structure research
- 2 upgrade categories
	- Body points
	- Kinetic/Thermal armour
- for every upgrade values should become 10% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +10% of base value, second upgrade: +21% of base value, third upgrade: +33,1% of base value etc. pp.)
- 5 upgrades for each upgrade category
	- cumulated research time: approx. 60 min
	- research time for every other upgrade depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,1 * x + 1,1^2 * x + 1,1^3 * x + 1,1^4 * x = 60 ==> x approx. 9 min 50 s
- defense structures need to be researched only once; with every new weapon the new bunkers, hardpoints etc. become available automatically
	- Problem here: resultstructure.txt does not allow you to define more than one research topic which is necessary for enabling the structure
	- Workaround: use ultrafast and ultracheap dummy research topics that require defense structure type + weapon research, researching this topic will result in the new structure

Sensor research
- no research

Repair research
- 3 upgrades for all repair turrets (auto-repair, mobile turret, repair facility)
- for every upgrade values should become 10% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +10% of base value, second upgrade: +21% of base value, third upgrade: +33,1% of base value etc. pp.)
- research topics do not only depend on the previous research topic (become available upon finishing researching other stuff)
- cumulated research time: approx. 30 min
- research time for every other upgrade depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,1 * x + 1,1^2 * x = 30 ==> x approx. 9 min 5 s

VTOL Rearming Pad research
- 3 upgrades
- for every upgrade values should become 10% better than they were previously (Be careful: First upgrade: +10% of base value, second upgrade: +21% of base value, third upgrade: +33,1% of base value)
- cumulated research time: approx. 20 min
- research time for every other upgrade depends on the time of the first upgrade x; for research time this means: x + 1,1 * x + 1,1^2 * x = 20 ==> x approx. 6 min

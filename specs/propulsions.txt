Propulsions					
Propulsion	Cost	Body Points	Mass	Speed	Propulsion Type
Tracks	high	high	high	low	ground
Hover	medium	medium	medium	high	ground+water
Cyborg/Legs	low	low	low	medium	ground
VTOL	high	low	low	very high	air
Cyborg Transport	high	high	high	medium	air

- Maximum speed is set to a very high value for all propulsions.
- Balancing is achieved by using other parameters to reduce unit maximum achievable speed such as masses or the % engine output in propulsiontypes.txt.
- By doing this we reduce the number of parameters that need to be balanced.
- No tank transport. Tanks have hover instead.
- Cyborg Transport uses original Tank Transport.
- Cyborg Transport costs and body points determined by body alone --> 0.
- For now do not make use of different speed modifiers on different grounds.

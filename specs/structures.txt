Structures
- two classes:
	- base structures
	- defensive structures

Base Structures
- HQ
	- equipped with surveillance sensor
- Power Generator (no modules; model of power generator with module)
- Research Facility (no modules; model of research facility with module)
- Factory (no modules; model of factory with modules)
- Cyborg Factory
- VTOL Factory (no modules; model of factory with modules)
- Repair Facility
- Rearming Pad
- Oil Derrick
- Command Relay Center

Defensive Structures
- Concrete Towers
	- only for sensors
- Hardpoints
	- for all weapons except AA and artillery
- Bunkers
	- for all weapons except AA and artillery
- Sites
	- only for AA and artillery
- Walls

- costs for hardpoints: 200 + round(cost(tank-weapon), nearest 50)

The idea is that bunkers cannot shoot over/through other bunkers and they cannot shoot over walls. Hardpoints can shoot over bunkers and walls, if the distance and the localisation of the target allow for this.

Unfortunately, Warzone 2100 master (2011-05-08) allows bunkers to shoot over/through other bunkers.

Structure types are cut down from SOFT, MEDIUM, HARD, BUNKER to MEDIUM (base structures), HARD (every non-bunker defensive structure) and BUNKER (all bunkers).

No Fortresses.
